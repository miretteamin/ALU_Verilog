# ALU_Verilog
 
This ALU supports the following 8 operations:
* Adding two 4-bit numbers.
* Subtracting two 4-bit numbers.
* Adding 1 to a 4-bit number.
* Subtracting 1 from a 4-bit number.
* Bitwise ANDing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise ORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Bitwise XORing two 4-bit numbers.
* Arithmetic shifting right of a 4-bit number that will discard the least significant bit.
The output of the ALU is a 5-bit number, where the additional bit is the most significant one.
